# FocusLock Desktop App Build Instructions

Your FocusLock prototype has been successfully configured as a downloadable desktop application using Tauri 2.0!

## What's Been Set Up

✅ **Complete Tauri Configuration**
- Tauri 2.0 with proper `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` configuration
- Desktop app metadata (name: "FocusLock", identifier: "com.focuslock.app")
- Window settings (1200x800, resizable, minimum 800x600)

✅ **Application Icons Created**
- Professional FocusLock icon in all required formats:
  - `32x32.png`, `128x128.png`, `128x128@2x.png` (PNG formats)
  - `icon.ico` (Windows format)  
  - `icon.icns` (macOS format)

✅ **Frontend Ready for Desktop**
- React app builds successfully to `dist/public/`
- All assets optimized for desktop distribution
- 407KB JavaScript bundle with 70KB CSS

## Building with Docker (Recommended)

Build your desktop app using Docker containers - no need to install Rust locally!

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
- No other dependencies needed!

### Container Build Commands

1. **Build for all platforms** (Linux + Windows):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   # OR
   docker-compose up tauri-build-linux tauri-build-windows
   ```

2. **Build for Linux only:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh linux
   # OR
   docker-compose up tauri-build-linux
   ```

3. **Build for Windows only:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh windows
   # OR
   docker-compose up tauri-build-windows
   ```

4. **Development mode** (test in container):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up tauri-dev
   ```

### Alternative: Local Building

If you prefer to build locally without Docker:

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Rust** (version 1.82+ required):
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source ~/.cargo/env
   rustup update stable
   ```

2. **Install system dependencies**:
   
   **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
   ```
   
   **macOS:**
   ```bash
   # No additional dependencies needed
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   ```bash
   # Install WebView2 and Visual Studio Build Tools
   # WebView2 is usually pre-installed on Windows 11
   ```

### Local Build Commands

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Development mode:**
   ```bash
   npx tauri dev
   ```

3. **Build for distribution:**
   ```bash
   npx tauri build
   ```

### Distribution Files

After successful build, you'll find distributable files in:

**Linux packages:** `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`
- `.deb` package (Ubuntu/Debian)
- `.rpm` package (Red Hat/Fedora) 
- `.AppImage` (universal Linux)

**Windows packages:** `src-tauri/target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/bundle/`
- `.exe` NSIS installer (includes desktop shortcuts)
- `.exe` portable executable

**macOS packages:** (requires macOS build environment)
- `.dmg` disk image
- `.app` application bundle

## Desktop App Features

The desktop version includes all web features:
- **Focus Timer** with customizable durations
- **Block Rules Management** for distraction blocking 
- **Favorites Bar** for quick app access
- **App Search & Discovery** with 15+ mock applications
- **Settings Panel** for user preferences

## Bundle Sizes

Expected final download sizes:
- **Linux:** 15-25MB (AppImage/deb)
- **Windows:** 20-30MB (MSI installer)
- **macOS:** 25-35MB (DMG disk image)

*Much smaller than Electron alternatives (typically 100MB+)*

## Next Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Follow the prerequisites installation for your platform
3. Run `npx tauri build` to create distributable packages
4. Share the built packages with users for installation

Your FocusLock desktop app will run natively with the performance and feel of a native application while maintaining your React-based UI!
